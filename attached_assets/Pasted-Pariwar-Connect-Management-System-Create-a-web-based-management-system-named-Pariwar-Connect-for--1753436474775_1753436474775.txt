Pariwar-Connect Management System
Create a web-based management system named "Pariwar-Connect" for Maharashtra BJP, designed to connect Admin, Leadership, and Member roles. The platform should feature a 3D animated background on the homepage, an interactive Maharashtra map with animated numbers, a custom-designed logo inspired by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, and a gradient-themed color scheme combining light tones with soil brown (#8B4513) as the dark color. The interface should be interactive, default to Marathi, and include a language switch button for English. Use Simple JavaScript, ReactJS, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for development. Below is the detailed prompt.

Project Overview
Develop a comprehensive web and mobile application called "Pariwar-Connect" to foster connection among Maharashtra BJP Admin, Leadership, and Members. The system will focus on member management, event coordination, announcements, leadership showcasing, and a dynamic homepage with special day highlights and an interactive Maharashtra map. The design should evoke pride, strength, and unity, drawing inspiration from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj for a culturally rich and emotionally engaging user experience.

üè† Dynamic Homepage Enhancements
3D Animated Background:
Implement a dynamic 3D background using WebGL or Three.js, inspired by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj (e.g., a rotating 3D depiction of Raigad Fort or a warrior silhouette with a saffron gradient).
Ensure smooth performance with lightweight animations suitable for mobile devices.

Maharashtra Map on Homepage:
Display an interactive SVG or WebGL-based Maharashtra map prominently on the homepage.
Highlight 288 constituencies with animated numbers (e.g., member count, active events) that increment smoothly on hover or page load.
Use saffron and soil brown accents with subtle 3D effects (e.g., elevation or glow on click).
Link map regions to constituency details (e.g., member lists, events).


Today's Special Day Section:
Include a small section displaying the current date (e.g., July 25, 2025, 02:16 PM IST) and significant observances (e.g., World Cancer Day, Republic Day, Ganesh Chaturthi).

Upcoming Special Days Section:
Include a small section listing upcoming observances within the next 30 days (e.g., Maharashtra Day, Diwali).
Show days remaining (dynamically calculated, e.g., "5 days left for Diwali").
Use a calendar API or predefined dataset for dynamic updates.

Language Switch:
Default to a Marathi interface for all text and labels (e.g., "‡§™‡•Å‡§®‡§É ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§ó‡§§ ‡§Ü‡§π‡•á‡§∏, ‡§™‡§æ‡§π‡§ø‡§ú‡•á ‡§∏‡§¶‡§∏‡•ç‚Äç‡§Ø").
Include a toggle button to switch to English, prominently placed (e.g., top-right corner).


Design Specifications
üé® Visual Design
Color Scheme: Combine light tones (e.g., white, light saffron #FFC107) with soil brown (#8B4513) as the dark color, featuring a gradient touch at the top of pages (e.g., saffron-to-soil brown gradient).
3D Animated Background: Use WebGL or Three.js for a dynamic 3D effect on the homepage, inspired by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj‚Äôs legacy (e.g., a rotating fort or warrior silhouette).
Logo Design:
Create a custom logo featuring:
A stylized silhouette of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj (e.g., on horseback or with a sword).

Example Workflow
Homepage Interaction: User lands on the homepage, sees a 3D animated background (e.g., rotating Raigad Fort), an interactive Maharashtra map with animated member counts (e.g., 1,247 as in the reference), and small sections for "Today's Special Day" (e.g., July 25, 2025) and "Upcoming Special Days" (e.g., "5 days to Maharashtra Day"). A button toggles between Marathi and English.
User Login: Admin logs in, sees the dashboard with stat cards (e.g., "‡§∏‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡•Ä‡§Ø ‡§∏‡§¶‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø" 1,247, "+20%") and gradient styling.
Member Management: Admin searches for members in a specific constituency, views profiles, and schedules a meeting.
Event Creation: Leadership creates an event, sends WhatsApp invites, and tracks RSVPs.
Notice Posting: Admin posts an urgent notice with a PDF attachment, pinned to the top.
Leadership Gallery: Members browse leader profiles, view achievements, and follow their X handles.
